### Memory Reodering
Several mechanisms can produce the reordering. A **Just-In-Time**(JIT) compiler in a Java Virtual Machine implementation may rearrange code, or the **processor**. In addition, the memory hierarchy of the architecture on which a Java Virtual Machine implementation is run may make it appear as if code is being reordered.
